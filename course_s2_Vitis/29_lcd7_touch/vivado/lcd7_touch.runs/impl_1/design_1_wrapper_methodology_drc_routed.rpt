2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on lcd_bl_pwm relative to clock(s) clk_pl_0
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/axi_dynclk_0/U0/Inst_mmcme2_drp/mmcm_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell design_1_i/axi_dynclk_0/U0/Inst_mmcme2_drp/mmcm_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>
